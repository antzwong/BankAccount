***Features***
UI for interaction with some sort of menu type of action\



***TODO***
figure out what's going on with the CheckingsAccount constructor
add functionality which prevents multiple of the same user from being added
see if there's a more efficient method for adding savings vs checkings accounts
change all ints to strings????
Check for the getters if they need this. in front of the variable
Issue where when savings accounts are made the withdraw limit is 0.0 instead of 500

might need to add a gitignore depending on what people push 




***Logs***
12/29/2019- worked on functionality for accessing a users individual accounts
