***Features***
UI for interaction with some sort of menu type of action
Add in JDBC connection



***TODO***
figure out what's going on with the CheckingsAccount constructor
add functionality which prevents multiple of the same user from being added
see if there's a more efficient method for adding savings vs checkings accounts
change all ints to strings????
Test the set withdraw limit to make sure its working properly
might need to add a gitignore depending on what people push 




***Logs***
12/29/2019- worked on functionality for accessing a users individual accounts
12/30/2019- Resolved issue where savings account withdraw value does not default to 500
